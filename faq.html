                                                <p>Simple analogy: before obtaining your driver’s license, you need to learn traffic regulations. There are two ways to do that. The boring way is to study the Driver’s Manual by yourself. The cool way is to
                                                    ask a driving instructor who would briefly summarize the most important rules you need to know. You still need to read the Driver’s Manual, but it is so much easier to manage it once you have an idea
                                                    about what’s going on. Of course, the actual driving is the most important step, but you would be nuts to drive on a highway without knowing how to switch lanes.</p>
